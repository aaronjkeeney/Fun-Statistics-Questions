## Fun Statistics Questions and Explorations ##

Welcome! This repository is full of statistics explorations that have been sparked by questions from students. Much of statistics is 
counterintuitive, especially since statistics is often taught before calculus. Throughout these exercises, I hope to provide examples of
the principles, patterns, and formulae that students have questioned. THESE ARE NOT PROOFS. Proofs are necessary, but often not the best
way -- at least initially -- to build a statistical intuition. The ability to manipulate parameters and produce visualizations allows us 
to bring a kinesthetic element to learning, which has been immensely helpful in my experience.

I welcome any comments or questions for clarity. These projects are still in the early stages, but hopefully they provide clarity and 
utility for the curious statistics student!
